Python - Object-relational mapping
In this project, I learned about how object-relational mapping is used for database scripting. I became familiar with using MySQLdb and SQLAlchemy to query, create, edit, and delete tables in MySQL.

Tests ✔️
tests: Folder of SQL and Python scripts for setting up test tables for all files. Provided by ALX.
Tasks 📃
0. Get all states

0-select_states.py: Python script that uses MySQLdb to list all states in the database hbtn_0e_0_usa.
Usage: ./0-select_states.py <mysql username> <mysql password> <database name>.
Results are ordered by ascending states.id.
